### NetProbe: A Network Troubleshooting Tool

This project is my self-directed effort to enhance my understanding of networking. NetProbe is a network troubleshooting tool offering native implementations of utilities such as `ping`, `dig` (as of yet).

It offers `npctl`, a CLI tool to interact with the integrated utilities.
